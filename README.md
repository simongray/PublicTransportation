Rejsekort Reminder
==================

An Android app that reminds users of the Rejsekort to check out in time. The app only supports the Copenhagen metropolitan area. It uses environmental context such as cell tower and wifi base station proximity as well as activity recognition to trigger automatic reminders around the time that the user gets off the bus, S-train, or Metro.

The app was originally a semester project (report: [available here][report]) developed for the Pervasive Computing Project class of 2013 at the IT University of Copenhagen. A [video demo][demo] was also created for the project showing how it works.

It is licensed with the GPL v3.
